Processing logs using Kinesis:

Refer presentation for more info:
====================================
--Launch 2 EC2 instance (micro instances should be fine
                          remember to have keypair created to access instances)
[we can use these instances to work with AWS services such as 'kinesis data stream']
[we can later use cloudwatch to monitor state of these instances]

connect to one of the EC2 instance (in my case m1) and

Now lets create stream with a shard count ( from command line) unlike earlier we did from AWS console.

aws kinesis create-stream --stream-name testKinesis --shard-count 1
aws kinesis describe-stream --stream-name testKinesis

Refer presentation for more info:
Now let's create a cloud watch event
services > cloudwatch > Events > rules > Service Name: Ec2
                                         Event Type : Ec2 instance state-change notification
					 We could choose 'Any state' or 'Specific states: pending/running/shutting-down/stopped/stopping/terminted'
					 Any instance/specific instances
				         Targets : Refer presentation ( choose Kinesis stream > testKinesis )
					 Roles : use an existing one or create new one 
configure details > name and description > create rule..

Now go to EC2 instances and stop the second instance (m2 in my case)

Go back to cloud watch, look for your events and click on 'show metrics for the rule'
>TriggeredRules (look into the graph)

Now from cli
we can access records from 'data stream'
aws kinesis get-shard-iterator --stream-name testKinesis --shard-iterator-type TRIM_HORIZON --shard-id shardId-000000000000
aws kinesis get-records --shard-iterator xxxxxx --limit 3
